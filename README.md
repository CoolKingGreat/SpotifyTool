# SpotifySortTool
The aim of this tool is to help Spotify users rediscover songs they have liked but forgot to add to a playlist. This tool collects information from a user's Spotify account to get their liked songs and then displays the songs that they have not yet added to any of their playlists. This web app utilizes NextJS and Tailwind CSS.
